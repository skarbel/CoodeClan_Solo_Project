            <p>League of Legends LoL, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.</p>
        
            <p>In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.</p>
